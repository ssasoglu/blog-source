# Earthquake in Kahramanmaras region, Turkey, 2023

As you can tell from the title, this is not a technical post. This is an initiative to create awareness and possible aid for people that are in the region. This is the first ever blog post that I had to create with such a heavy, broken heart. Thank you, Çağrı and Özge (my current team mates) for their contribution to create this content.

You might have already heard but a terrible disaster has happened in Turkey, and Syria. The southeastern region of Turkey has been hit by two major earthquakes (with the magnitude of 7.8 and 7.5) and numerous aftershocks that mainly affected ten cities and approximately more than 13,5 million people. The affect of these two earthquakes are extending to our neighboring countries such as Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. The numbers for causalities are constantly increasing.

## Size of the affected region

You can see from [here (in Dutch)](https://nos.nl/collectie/13922/video/2462923-hoe-groot-is-de-ramp-nu-precies) or [here (in English)](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-64540696) how big the disaster is.

According to a Turkish earthquake expert that reported to the Economist, “180,000 people or more may be trapped under the rubble”. Turkey has declared a state of emergency due to these earthquakes. While many people are still waiting for help under the rubble, others are trying to survive under the freezing weather conditions with an insufficient supply of their basic needs. This is a disaster that we never could have imagined, even in our worst nightmares. It's the worst disaster we (Turkey) have had in the last 100 years.

## How can you help?

Under these conditions, people in the region need immediate help and financial aid.
